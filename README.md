## Getting Started

This project uses [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) for setting environmental variables during development. Simply copy the `.env.example` file, rename it to `.env` and add your env variables as you see fit.
There is also a `src/config.js` file with several configuration options.

### Install, Seed DB & Start the server

```
yarn install
yarn seed
yarn start
```

The server will start at `http://localhost:3001`

## Deployment to Heroku

```
heroku login
heroku create my-app
git init
heroku git:remote -a my-app
git add .
git commit -am "initial commit"
git push heroku master
```

## Project structure

```
-| src/
 |--| app/: Main application (framework) files.
 |--| common/: Reusable common files such as messages, validation rules, services, utils etc.
 |--| features/: Features bundled into separate modules
 |--| seeds/: DB seed files
 |--| config.js: Global application config file
 |--| index.js: Application entry file
```

## Prettier

This project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), an opinionated code formatter. In order to format code manually, run `yarn format` in app root directory. All the code is also formatted automatically on `pre-commit` hook. There is also `yarn format-check` for CI purposes to check if code is formatted properly.

## ESLint

Project comes with ESLint configured. It helps you prevent common errors.

There are multiple ways how to run ESLint.

- CLI: `yarn lint`
- it runs automatically on `pre-commit` hook
- in IDE if supported (Visual Studio Code supports reports)

## Updating dependencies

Project comes with the default [Renovate](https://renovatebot.com) config `renovate.json`. It takes care of automated dependency updates and it's free for open-source projects. More about how to [configure here](https://renovatebot.com/docs).
